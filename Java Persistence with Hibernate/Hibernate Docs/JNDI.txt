Hibernate does optionally interact with JNDI on the applicationâ€™s behalf. Generally, it does this when the application:
- has asked the SessionFactory be bound to JNDI
- has specified a DataSource to use by JNDI name
- is using JTA transactions and the JtaPlatform needs to do JNDI lookups for TransactionManager, UserTransaction, etc
