1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,310
Welcome back one of the most important concepts behind JP is this thing called an entity manage it in

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,360
this and a series of next couple of steps we would look at NTT manager in detail.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,330
We'll try and understand all the background details about the entity manager to be able to understand

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,640
the manager in depth.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:34,340
What we do is we create a simple playground method call this public wide play with the manager.

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,640
I couldn't find a better name than that because there are a lot of things I would want to play with

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,860
related to the entity manager.

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,480
So let's use that name.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,310
I'm creating this in the course repository.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,390
And what I would want to do is I would want to be able to.

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,340
This is the de-bug.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,160
So I would need the debug thing which is running in the background because depositary test actually

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,130
start with a simple test.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,290
It's just a very simple test.

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,040
And just call this play with entity manager I swear.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,390
And over here what we would want to do is just to get off the method which is present in the supposedly

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,460
all that we want to do is play with entertainment minute that depositary taught want this stuff we don't

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,580
need all this I would just want to get play with it and manage it play with the manager because it was

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:40,550
a test would call the code repository method play with an entity manager and log word or debug it in

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,970
full.

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,840
OK I don't have a lot going on here.

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,080
So it's pull out the logger from here just so that we are very clear of what's happening where I pulled

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,010
out the logger and let's say lovebird in full we are to you.

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,740
Play with it.

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,150
Did he manage it.

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,240
But OK I guess we have all set up that is needed.

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,600
Let's run this.

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,450
What will happen is the application contacts get Sloan.

29
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:16,590
So the scheme is created the data is inserted and you can see that the within 15 minutes start is triggered

30
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,500
here.

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,500
So that's good.

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,870
So we now have the team manager play with the manager at methedrine he said.

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,050
Now let's start playing with them to the manager what I would want to start off by creating a simple

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
call and saving it.

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,720
So I would want to say entity manager dart assist Sainty manager that person is used to create a new

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,170
thing.

37
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,730
So if you want to create a new entity that's dispersement that adds a new course of what is what you

38
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,590
would want to do.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,220
So let's say the new cars that I would want to create is verb's services in steps.

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,950
So as we saw earlier this would create a euro.

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,110
So it would create a ticket to insert query and instead that through into the database.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,200
Now inside of this what I would want to do is take a step further I shift.

43
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,330
I'll dig this into a local variable I'll call this course I'm setting a new name for this I'll say start

44
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,830
said name.

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,540
So he's got 100 steps updated vild this update be saved.

46
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,040
So what would happen.

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,420
Let's try and run.

48
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,070
So not this actually have to run the course repository just like chronicity and it does.

49
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,690
Let's see what Lobban to consume.

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,870
Just accept that.

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,670
I would definitely know.

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,000
But would the update be fired.

53
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,390
So the is inserted.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,950
What is the details that are inserted into the code.

55
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,340
So within a hundred steps that's pretty cool.

56
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,910
And you can see that here there is also an update code name to call to question mark with a question

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,480
mark.

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,540
So it's also updating the new value that I have set it into the name into the database.

59
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,960
So what's happening in the background is when I run this when this method is called first.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,270
This is getting inserted and then this rule is getting saved to the database as well.

61
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,460
But I'm not really requested to save this.

62
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,200
How is this data getting saved.

63
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,310
One of the important things is the transactional annotation.

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,510
So this and that method is in a single transaction and while we are within the scope of a transaction

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,500
entity manage it keeps track of all the things that were inserted through it that were updated with

66
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,690
whatever things were mortified through it.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,920
And the manager would start keeping track of them.

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,950
In this example the course is something which is being inserted through the into the main page.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,950
So whatever changes I make to decors are kept track of by the entity manager.

70
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,280
I don't really need to say did the manager or dot merge this to save the details.

71
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,930
What the manager does is it would keep track of all the things that managed through it in here.

72
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,700
And whenever there's a change on it it would make sure that that changes as the state did the database.

73
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,580
Let's do one thing.

74
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's actually call the repository directly with the manager in our launch of the application.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,060
So I'll do a window prospect to open perspective job.

76
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,900
So I'll go back to our perspective.

77
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,940
I'll open up the day on one application class and what I would want to do is not really do all the stuff

78
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,750
in here right now.

79
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,020
So let's not need all this stuff.

80
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:40,800
All that I would want to do is play with entertainment riposted or play with the manager.

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,990
That's the only thing which is called From the day my application right now.

82
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,870
That's everything.

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,760
And to be the implication again.

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,800
So what we are doing in the play with the manager as of now is clearly in your goals and setting and

85
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,170
Neme and we saw that when we were running the unit there was a query which was fired to get the update

86
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,610
then.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,590
But now I would want to actually show you the same thing in the database go back to the history control

88
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,610
continue.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,050
On its Web services in hundred scripts.

90
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,890
So what are what changes which we are doing in here are actually reflected down to the database.

91
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,760
Okay.

92
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,270
So that lesson number one on NTD manage it.

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
So if you were actually in say the track thats lesson number one about NTT manager I know you are inside

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,770
the transaction and you are managing something with the entity manager when you are updating something

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,270
or deleting something or you inserting something in that particular thing continues to be managed by

96
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,870
the entity manager until the end of the transaction to be called here.

97
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:55,700
Even though I only saved it here what I would change is you are doing two because later in the transaction

98
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,410
are also being tracked by the entity manager and they are also assisted.

99
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,340
So if I do or said name something after that as well.

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:12,120
Then the manager keeps track of those changes and says them we'll talk a lot more about the manager

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,480
in the next step on the line.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,880
But by.
