1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,070
Welcome back in this step we'll try and replace all that we have learned about and manage it.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,130
India-A manager is a symbol in the face.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,510
It's an interface to something called persistent gone text.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,840
So persistence context is a very important concept as far as GPA is concerned.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,370
Here we are playing with a lot of entities.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,920
One is an entity cause to an entity.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,890
And there might be other entities we are playing with in a single transaction.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:43,640
All the entities that are being saved through the entity manager are thieved to something called persistence

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,370
gone.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:51,000
It's the persistence context keeps track of all the different entities which are changed during this

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,700
transaction.

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,300
And also it keeps track of all the changes that needs to be stored back to the database.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,130
And we saw that in the manager of course a lot of different methods right.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,160
It offers a lot of fine methods to be able to execute queries against the database and retrieve data

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,010
back.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,230
It offers both this method so that I can save.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,880
I can create an entity in the database and the manager MoJ method help me to save the changes that I

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,140
have done because down to the database we can delete an entity by using the Remove method.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,500
We also Lubet the flush method which helps to persist all the changes until enough down to the database

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,720
in the middle of a transaction as well.

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,390
And also we look that refreshed method which helps us to override the changes and refresh the content

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,680
from the database.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,370
We also have the detachment that we would detach the entity from the persistence context what happened

24
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,190
with the detachment that is that particular entity.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,030
Changes to it are no longer tracked by the entity manager.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,250
The manager is a very important thing for you to understand.

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,120
So I would recommend you to play around with the entity manager and also try and the different stuff

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,140
which is present inside the interface and the manager until the next step.
