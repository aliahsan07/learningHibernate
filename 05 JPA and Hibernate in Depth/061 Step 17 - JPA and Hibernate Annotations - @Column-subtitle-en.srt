1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,590
This step let's look at another important annotation call.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,310
So at column I can't specify the name of the column.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,120
So here I can say this name column is not really name it's old.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,110
It's called name.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,190
I can do something of that kind.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,530
So what would happen.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,920
The table in the column in the table this field maps do would be full named.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:34,870
So whenever you update name the changes would be sent to a column named fullname.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,330
Let's write that.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,310
Let's change data sequel.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:49,010
Here it should be Fullam because in the table it's fully if I stop and start the application and refresh

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,600
to see the code what does it have.

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,170
It has fully named the name of the column in the table is full Lim.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,520
However the name of the field is different so in that case I can use the name is icle different name.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,440
And what are the important attributes which represent in the column.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Let's look at them right now.

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:16,910
All of the important things that is present in column attribute is something called Lebel to label is

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,500
equal to.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,230
That means name cannot have a null value.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,060
So let's say I'm going to the unit test.

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,280
So let's go to the uniters that we have.

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:37,190
Relate it to the courts depositary to Wall Street it and we have a play written to the manager method

23
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,390
which is present in here which is being called from here.

24
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,950
So let's use that.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,100
Now if in here let's say I'm sitting of course the data set name of this so let's clear all this stuff

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,870
out.

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,410
So I would commit all this stuff which is present in here.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,670
I just leave this stuff which is related to course what so we're creating course when you're setting

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,690
the name of what to do.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Let's see what would happen.

31
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,010
What do you think will happen.

32
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,540
Police work from the unit test just doesn't it.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,620
So play with it to the manager.

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,080
As you know as it continues to succeed that astonishes me how does it happen.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,190
Let's go and look at it again.

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,300
The reason I think happened is we did not call it the his method on Quarterman So I would say persist

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,780
of course with because we did not call the police this matter and the manager is not really managing

38
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,410
the entity yet.

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,900
So that's the reason why it did not fail.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,720
Now let's run that again.

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,870
You see that it's failing a database integrity violation exception.

42
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,530
Why is it failing.

43
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,550
Because now what we said is this is non nullable field.

44
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:04,190
This field cannot be null even if you look at the console and just go a little bit up and see the table

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,290
definition create table code.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,060
It creates a table with a not null definition so this field cannot be null.

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,100
And if you look at it here it is data business school exception.

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,050
That is not allowed for this specific column.

49
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,990
So it's very good practice for you to specify things like this.

50
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,200
What this would prevent is bad data coming through.

51
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,400
So in your application you want the data quality to be a really really good.

52
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,070
So all the possible constraints that you have in your data.

53
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,990
It's good to set them using your column annotations to really get couple of them.

54
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,330
So we started with name and then we moved to nullable.

55
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,450
The other things which are present in them are what is unique.

56
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,050
Space.

57
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,050
If this is a unique value across the table this value will be unique.

58
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,200
For example feel like SSN.

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,040
Those kind of fields are unique.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,190
So even though you don't want to use SSN as a primary key you can specify a unique constraint on that

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,780
specific field.

62
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,800
You can't say whether it's nullable whether it's insertable.

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,610
So whenever you say a column is insertable falls then whenever an insert is then whenever a new rule

64
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,500
is created in that table that column will not be sent.

65
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,410
So the Indians initial insert query that column will not be sent.

66
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,500
You have updateable available through to indicate if that column needs to be included in the update

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,390
statements that are sent.

68
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,850
So if you put updateable physical default then in all the update for that entity that particular column

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,450
will not be sent.

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,320
The other attributes which you can specify on the column and addition are lent.

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,560
So if it's a string field you can specify the maximum length so you can say this field is maximum 255

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,550
characters and things like that.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,230
You can if it's a number of fields.

74
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,930
You can also specify scale and position in the step below that some of the important things related

75
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,360
to the add column and addition redefined a different name for this specific column.

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,560
And also we look at what happens when I have an infallible set to false.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,260
And we also look at various different attributes that are allowed on top of this annotation.

78
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,400
What we'll do now is really quickly report all the changes that we have done.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,090
So I don't want to use the I would want to leave the nullable as false in here.

80
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,060
That's cool but I don't want to name as a full name so I'll go ahead and change this and change this

81
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,090
as change that it will back.

82
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,570
So now you would have a proper running application.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,500
And I see you on the next step.

84
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,860
All right.
