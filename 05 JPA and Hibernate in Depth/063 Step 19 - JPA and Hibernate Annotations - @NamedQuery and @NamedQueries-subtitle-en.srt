1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,790
Welcome back in the step we look at named query annotations.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,510
So if you look at this specific thing we are actually hand-coding decree in.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,260
So this means if I have to use it to use the query somebody else they will need to hardcoded again.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,080
I would need to type in the entire area again named queries will help you to prevent that.

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,210
So with named queries you can assign a name to a query and use it.

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,960
So how do I create a named query.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,400
It's very simple I can go to court for example this is the entity here right here I can add a Nemed

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:51,390
queries a named query about Ixtoc persistence and all here I can fake the name for a query that get

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,500
on course.

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:04,830
I would like to end it with a query query get all quotes this and comma you can specify the query set.

11
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,020
What's the query query we want to use.

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,380
Is this select see from quotes.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,550
This becomes a named query and this can be used in other things.

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:31,070
Now I can use here instead of create query I can say create a named query to create named query using

15
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,760
what is to get all courses.

16
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:43,660
You get to create named query and it was created Get this.

17
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,980
So let's see what would happen if you run as a unit test.

18
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,430
I'm running all three tests.

19
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,120
OK.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,570
So this once.

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,530
So you would see that the queries are properly run and you are getting the right details out.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,270
This is selected from.

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,050
That's perfect.

24
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,770
It's getting all the details and it's printing all the details out here that's good so that unnamed

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
query where you'd see that.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,480
Here we have another query that I would want to create a named query for this as well.

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,110
How can they do that.

28
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:25,160
And let's say I come here and say at named query name is it to create a Get hundred step code.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,590
This let's call it that way.

30
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,190
And I would try and put the queries equal to the query which I copied.

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,480
Ha.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,610
You can see that there is an error coming up saying duplicate an addition of a non-repeatable type named

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,590
query.

34
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,920
So this is not really a repeatable annotation.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,260
So because of that what happens is I cannot do something of this kind.

36
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,740
What I would need to do is when I want to define multiple name queries I would need to use another.

37
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,230
In addition it is called named Kuwaiti's so jolly expose's since named queries.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,580
And while we're here I can see value is equal to all here.

39
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,680
I have to define and write off named queries.

40
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,870
So name query come up under that name for it.

41
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,340
And this is how you would do a set of name queries.

42
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,400
So that is how you define multiple name queries.

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,160
This is not really any easy way of doing it.

44
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,110
So now I have defined this so I would want to use the named query here as well.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,970
So let's do that create named query.

46
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:53,010
That's cool and that should run the unit as depicted in this league.

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,370
So it's a green but if you look at the queries you'll see that the queries are perfectly fine.

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,210
So that's cool isn't it.

49
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:06,800
So in this step what we look at Didn't named query and didn't name the Kuwaitis and the station name

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,590
is used when you want to just define one query.

51
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,540
But when you want to define multiple queries then you need to use a combination of named query and named

52
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,190
queries until the next step.

53
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,480
Boy.
