1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,170
Let's create a project which would serve as the starting point for all at once stupid stuff we would

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,830
want to create a main project with our I'm using sping good to go door to door and.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,980
It's fine to use any question which is about that group ID and crookedest coming 28 minutes to be hyper

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,580
knit and the artifact name.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm just giving it us all.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,300
So it's Group ID coming.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
When did I hibernate the artifact name.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,380
I'm giving it us more.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,140
That's basically the name of the application that we're creating.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,610
What I've already done is I've chosen in three dependencies who rob JP hitched to.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,380
So these are the three dependences that you would need once you choose this dependencies.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,710
We are all set to get rocking and rolling and click and it will download a zip code.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,000
We have done this multiple times earlier so it should be ready for you.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,970
You can import this into your eclipse.

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,160
How do you do that.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,830
I have extracted the zip and placed it on some folder on my hard disk.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:13,370
What I need to do is do a file import existing Maimon projects choose the next and choose the directory

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:20,720
where you expect that this file to have extracted it in 20 minutes get and hibernate with spring boot

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,120
0 2 GPA it grants that to follow where extracted the it do.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,350
And I am importing it right now.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,450
I'm clicking the finish.

22
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,780
This would import the project so it could bring Mavin into picture and make an orderly departure that

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,070
example and it would import everything that is needed to execute this project.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,490
If this is the first time you are using that to pursue question of spring boot this might really take

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,010
a little while because this would download all the dependencies onto your local mayor with repository

26
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,760
and use them to create your project once the project is created.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,510
It would look something like this you have two main Jowa.

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,710
This is where we would put all call in all up production code so spend resources this way we would put

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,340
all the configuration.

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,460
The application properties which is already present in there.

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,860
If let's say I would want to quote something about spring I would want to go to the something about

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,830
hibernate or that compilation can be done in application to properties.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,040
We also have source Jowers as Java is the place where all this code would go.

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,510
We would write a lot of uniters during this code and all the tests that we would be writing would be

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,180
present in all this.

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,350
Show all the test code that we would write over here will not be really part of the deployable.

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,190
What do you mean by deployable.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:43,940
When our code goes to production we would create a job or over all that this code will not be part of

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,730
that job.

40
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,160
Our work dress code is to ensure that all the code is working fine.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,790
It does not really need it to run your application in production.

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,750
Other than that you would see maybe in dependencies which are present in here.

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,710
You have a wide variety of Mavin dependencies which are coming in because we chose three dependencies

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,250
in here.

45
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,770
Right rituals G-B G.P.A. do and Rabbe.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,050
So if I open a pondered XML you'd see that there are those dependencies to be started in AJP.

47
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,970
So I wrote web and teched these had three things we treat you with.

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,250
And these are the three things which are present in here.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,000
In addition always spring would add in a test dependency.

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,950
So the spring initialiser by default.

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,810
Add to that dependency on the standard test.

52
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,520
This is the one which we'll be using to write are you need yes to make sure that you have your application

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,790
running what you can do.

54
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,770
They might piggishness do it right click on it and see it run s g on it.

55
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,710
Just so this would launch up a test.

56
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,230
This test would launch up something called Spring boot context and this would check whether everything

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,140
is just fine or not.

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,270
If the first time you're locking it up it will take a little while.

59
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,180
So let's be a little patient with it and or some time you'd see that the application will launch.

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,240
And if I want to see the control look into windows show view and I can bring up the control.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,900
You can see the console in here.

62
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,240
With all the load that is being printed there is a lot of log which is coming in here.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,930
The generated bad shows are green but the shows J and it has succeeded.

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,270
The other thing you can also do is to add more piggish and rightly Granice job application and see that

65
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,140
you would be able to ram that Texas film.

66
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,040
What I recommend you to do is play around so try and see what's in here try and spend some time looking

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,590
at the folder structure and see what is in the palm read SML and other things like that and I will see

68
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,870
you in the next step.
