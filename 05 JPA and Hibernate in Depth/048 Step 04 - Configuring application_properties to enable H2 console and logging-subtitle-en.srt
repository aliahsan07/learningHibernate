1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,190
Now that we have a simple entity working this is the best time to play around.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,400
And also to understand what's happening in the bag in this step what we'll do is we'll turn on a few

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,990
things.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,220
One of the things is we are using which to the database so that's an in memory database and we would

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,040
want to see what the days present in there.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:29,520
So we would need to turn to control on so that we can look at what the data in the background.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:35,140
The other thing is we want to find out what the Kuwaitis Hibernate is generating what is happening in

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,760
the background with highborn.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,240
So we'll turn on something called hibernates statistics and also we will print all the queries which

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,250
are being fired in the log.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:53,770
Let's get started with doning the hitch to control on how we get down to control on spring door to door

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,840
control door enable user code to do that as simple as that.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,760
This would enable to control when we launched we launched up next or this would be enabling her to control

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,110
next what we want to do is we would want to learn statistics.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,170
So how do I turn hibernates statistics on.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,530
I would want to see what's happening in the background with hibernated would want to see statistics

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,310
on it.

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,190
Is it spring.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,860
JP You don't want to configure a property for the JPA so properties Dorte we get into the custom field

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,330
so I would want to configure the hibernate property and what we want to do is hibernate got generate

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,760
steady sticks is equal to.

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,190
This would help us generate a lot of statistics on how many queries are fired what's happening in the

24
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,080
background and all that kind of stuff.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:52,660
In addition I would want to set the logging level for one of the specific packages that are not hibernate.

26
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:00,160
Just this package which is in hibernate which is dispensable for statistics Alt-A say the logging level

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,850
for this to debug.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,400
The next thing I would want to do show all queries show all queries.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,390
So I would want to see what queries are being fired.

30
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,800
So I'll just bring dot G.P.A. dot Sure.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,760
Q Well is equal to.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,280
This is good because this withdrawal all decrease.

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,870
However what I would also want to do is I would want to see what Bajrami does being say to these queries.

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,840
We want the courts ten thousand one so ten thousand one is a bad rap meet it if I want to be able to

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:36,370
see what parameters are being sent into this this would enable the debug logging for this package.

36
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,350
This is the package which is used when setting paramita.

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,780
So and the last thing I would want to also make sure is I would want to be able to format the queries

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,130
by default the queries which are printed are not formatted.

39
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,370
What we want to do is format the queries as well.

40
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,320
This is a hibernate property.

41
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,370
So the way we do that is format and usko.

42
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,960
Q Is equal to when or where you would want to customize something related to hibernate or that you need

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,490
to do is to paint that G.P.A. properties do it.

44
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,210
So let's get started with that in the application.

45
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,690
Let's see what would happen.

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,850
Let's stop the application and keep forgetting.

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,230
You'd see a lot of things that are printed in the console what we'll do is we'll take it step by step

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,700
and see what's happening.

49
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:32,530
So one of the first things which is happening is a biblical code is being the springboard has this feature

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,920
called auto configuration when springboards sees that there is an embedded database being used to it

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,840
in a database so Springboro cease OK this guy is using it in a database.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,790
So I would want hibernate to create this key for me.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,530
So it would turn something called create Kema on.

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,590
So what would happen is hibernate would look at the different entities which are present in there and

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,440
create this key for them create all the tables that are needed.

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,670
So that's how the table is being created.

57
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,840
The table is being created because of springboard auto configuration Springboro the configuration enables

58
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,370
the schema create and hibernate would create that schema for us.

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,300
So that's number one.

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,910
Next thing you would see is the execution of the sequel.

61
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,770
So what we have done earlier is created a file called data that sequel with a few ladies when spring

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,920
would seize a date or rescue will then that get executed.

63
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,180
That's what you see next in here.

64
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,160
So you'll see that the queries which are present in the data are not at school are being executed.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,120
The thing is you did a school script from your date or the sequel that calls or whatever code we have

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,200
in there would be created mixed what we have is that right we clear the command line in which we are

67
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,080
running a query.

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,570
What we are doing is get the details of course.

69
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:11,440
So the query which is being fired is select the ID name from cord's where Id is equal to this.

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,190
What is the ID that is being sent am unable to see the ID that is being sent.

71
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,580
Lets look at it a little later for you know.

72
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,930
You can also see that there are metrics being put into it saying I've spent this much time preparing

73
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,860
the JTB statements excluding DJT with his statements and a lot of statistics that are being printed

74
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,370
for now.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,030
These are the two one two that are important for us so the queries being fired and how much time its

76
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,230
taking for that school and B that they called 10000 1 which is what we put into the dialogue.

77
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,440
When did you hear that call.

78
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,710
Right.

79
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,110
So what is happening is this is being created.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,130
The data is being populated.

81
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,490
However one thing that concerns me is the fact that de-value which is passed here is not being printed.

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,140
Lets look at why its not happening.

83
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
I go to the application of our properties.

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,440
So we said logging level or hibernate type is equal to debug.

85
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,880
Actually I made a mistake.

86
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,800
It should have been.

87
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,450
Chris you have to say the hibernate type 2 3 is to be able to see the values that are being assigned

88
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,490
to the bed and we do.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,510
Lets go that off of the application started again.

90
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,160
Cool.

91
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,900
Now if you see that cause the and what is the tape.

92
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,270
So its saying OK this is ten thousand one thats good.

93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,430
So by adding paramita one begin 10000 one.

94
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,090
Now I am able to see even the parameter values.

95
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,230
I'm able to see a decision matrix which are being printed in here.

96
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,170
How many queries are fired how many caches and other stuff which we'll talk about a little later but

97
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,040
for now what we have is good application.

98
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,810
So we are able to file a query.

99
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,150
We are able to see what's happening in the background.

100
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,140
And that's really good.

101
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,820
One of the things which will focus on doing this cause is not just trying to understand how to do something

102
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,900
with JPK but also trying to understand what's happening in the background.

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,300
So we look at the statistics and look at the general Greeley's and all that stuff.

104
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,980
And in this step we set that up.

105
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,240
So congratulations and I'll see you in the next step.
