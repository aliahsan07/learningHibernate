1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,080
We'll come back in the previous step.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:11,640
We saw that in the manager within a transaction keeps track of all the things that Adam managed it.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,020
So when you call into the manager or entity manager or merge you are in agreement on a specific object

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,500
when a specific entity.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,100
What are the changes that are done to that entity in the rest of the transaction are all sort of tracked

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,820
by the entity manage it and the state to the database.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,950
Let's look at another example.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,320
So courses there to create a quartz one.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,200
This is of course one called two and the two in in the quarter to quarter one and let's create a new

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,470
one called two and that this code through.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,700
And of course 2.70 that's cool.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,660
Right now this code is but this did by the manager.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,390
And this one is octopus's had been into the manager.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,750
Let's give it a different name.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,890
So it's no longer there.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:07,920
So Weezer's Let's call this angle Jesus and Oh here we are actually setting and logis in 100 steps.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,460
Updated you know what would happen when this gets started again.

18
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,790
It's the courts when details get saved and the courts do the deal.

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,260
Also get to the well.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,260
So is this an hundred steps and allergies in a hundred steps.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,810
So that's what you would see.

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,270
You can start BBDO here and run the application and see what would happen if you manage it also has

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,440
a method called flush into the manager to flush what entity manager that flush does it.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,020
The changes which are done until then they would be sent out to the database so I can call into the

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:50,700
manager at plush and multiple places so that the changes up to that point are sent out of the database.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,140
So now you can see this basic transaction as four steps right.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,210
So the first step is creating the code.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,160
Then we get a bidding because one actually to be accurate in quarter one and abrading quotes.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,490
And we are creating calls and upgrading calls to let's say I don't want the calls to change just to

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,130
be going to the database.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,200
So after this stage I don't want all the calls to data details to go to the database at all.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,760
How can I do that.

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,740
There's another method in the manager.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,740
So let's say in city manager Darren Deedat cost.

35
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,720
So what would happen after this is the changes to course to are no longer tracked by the entity manager.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,060
So what you would see that goes to that set name will not be executed if they kill the application and

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,440
start again and go to the H-2 control.

38
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,930
You see that the because to name remains that Anglo is in handed steps Kitchener's started up you would

39
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,980
see that the debate which is done did the courts do which was Ankiel just in a hundred steps are not

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,240
being saved because after the document that is called on us Pacificare entity that entity is no longer

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,480
tracked by the entity manager.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,610
Let's say I am creating the courses first let's say I move this stuff also or don't support someone

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,720
not to name the objects.

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,220
The courses I'm actually moving them a little down.

45
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,420
I also remove the flash in here so that we kind of treat this as two steps right.

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,330
The first step is creation of all the cards that flush it.

47
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,930
So they are sent to the database and then I'm detaching only chords to for now.

48
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,500
So what would happen if you ran it only close to his detection.

49
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,050
So one name would be said to webservices in hundred steps.

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,680
Updated Howard-Costello name will not be updated because ghost 2 is not tracked by the entity manager

51
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,670
anymore.

52
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,610
If I wanted to do that one then I can do this as well.

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,520
So the manager don't detach.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,450
Of course one could find that if you ran this application and see the stock until you would see that

55
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,790
the date would be as it is here.

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,750
So it would be web services a hundred steps and ledges in hundred steps.

57
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,620
These updates will not be saved to the database because those entities are not backed by the entity

58
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,760
manager at all.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,680
The other way of not tracking entities is by clearing everything out to ensure of calling Dadge on everything.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,410
You can also say the manager not clear.

61
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,410
So this would clear everything that is there in the entity manager so it would clear out everything

62
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,130
that is being practised by the manager and everything including quotes when calls to will not be tracked

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,860
and whatever changes you make to them will not be flushed out will not be saved to the database.

64
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,900
Let's kill the application started again.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,160
You'll see that the data in the database.

66
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,350
These two values the update will not be saved to it is refresh.

67
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,840
Can you please on.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,240
So you can see the first two rows in here.

69
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,970
So within hundred trips and ledges in hundred steps the updates are not saved to the database.

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:17,090
So in this step we look at how you can have the manager not track a few entities.

71
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,320
So by default the manager tracks everything.

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,610
If you want to track a few entities you can tap into the demand or detach.

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
If you want to clear everything out you can call into the manager directly.

74
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,960
And then the next step for.
